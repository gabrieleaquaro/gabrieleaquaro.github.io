In particoular we developed one system to calssify wich pixels in an image were 'plant'/'grass' or background. This experience gave me a good confidence with Tensorflow and keras, bootsting also my ability in evaluating models. In particular for the segmentation problem, we fine-tuned a UNET network, because some times you have to acknoledge that the state of the art is called so for a reason. ",
